## <a name="release_notes">Release notes for version 2.0.5 </a>

### What's changed:

- Proguard rules now avoids OkHttpâ€™s optional TLS providers.

## <a name="install">Installation</a>

- Install the Mopinion Native Android SDK Library by following the next steps.
- Download our [Mopinion Forms](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mopinion.mopinion) app
  from the Google Play Store to preview what your mobile forms will look like in your app.

### Step 1:

Add the JitPack repository to your `build.gradle` root file. Add it at the end of repositories:

```
allprojects {
		repositories {
		    ...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

In newer versions of Android Studio this repository will have to be set in `settings.gradle` file of
the project as the following:

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            ...
            url 'https://www.jitpack.io'
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2:

Install the Mopinion Native Android SDK by adding it to the `build.gradle` module level of
your project. The minimal required Android API is 21.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    //For the full version
    implementation("com.github.Mopinion-com.native-android-sdk:mopinion-sdk:2.0.5")
    //For the webview version
    implementation("com.github.Mopinion-com.native-android-sdk:webview-sdk:2.0.5")
}
```

### Step 2 using Versions Catalog
```
[versions]
mopinion="CURRENT_VERSION"
...

[libraries]
mopinion-sdk = { group = "com.mopinion.native-android-sdk", name = "mopinion-sdk", version.ref = "mopinion" }
```

### Step 3:

The library needs to communicate with Mopinion Servers, please make sure you have the Internet
permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.app">
    
		<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
		
		<application
		...
```

### Step 4:

This SDK contains view components that extend from MaterialComponents. Your application theme needs to extend from a MaterialComponents theme.
In case you can not change the application theme, and you have to use AppCompat themes mandatory, then you can use a MaterialComponent Bridge theme.
Both Theme.MaterialComponents and Theme.MaterialComponents.Light have .Bridge themes:

- Theme.MaterialComponents.Bridge
- Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.Bridge
- Theme.MaterialComponents.NoActionBar.Bridge
- Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar.Bridge
- Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.DarkActionBar.Bridge

Bridge themes inherit from AppCompat themes, but also define the new Material Components theme attributes for you. If you use a bridge theme, you can start using Material Design components without changing your app theme.

For more information, please visit [MaterialComponents implementation steps](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started).

### Java Time API Support

This SDK uses java.time APIs (such as LocalDateTime) for handling date and time logic. While Android added support for java.time starting from API 26 (Oreo), full support without desugaring is only available from API 33 (Android 13) and above.
If your app supports devices with API < 33 (which most apps do), you need to enable core library desugaring in your build.gradle to ensure compatibility:

```groovy
defaultConfig {
    // Required when setting minSdkVersion to 20 or lower
    multiDexEnabled true
}

compileOptions {
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5'
    ...
}
```


## <a name="implement">Implementing the SDK</a>

## Kotlin

- In your MainActivity.kt, Mopinion object will be initialised, it will require two values, one
  `Application` and one `String` with the `deployment key`, as the following:

```kotlin
Mopinion.initialise(this.application, "DEPLOYMENT_KEY")
```

- Once Mopinion is initialised, it is possible to instantiate Mopinion object wherever we need it,
  keep in mind that it's processes will be lifecycle aware, to instantiate a Mopinion object it will
  require one value, an `AppCompatActivity` or `FragmentActivity`:

  Activity:

```kotlin
import com.mopinion.mopinion_android_sdk.*

class SomeActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var mopinion: Mopinion

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        //This can be called from onCreate()
        mopinion = Mopinion(this)
        //Somewhere in the class where needed, .event can be called.
        mopinion.event("action") {
        }
    }
}
```

- Fragment:

```kotlin
import com.mopinion.mopinion_android_sdk.*

class SomeFragment : Fragment() {
    private lateinit var mopinion: Mopinion

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        //This can be called from onViewCreated()
        mopinion = Mopinion(requireActivity())
        //Somewhere in the class where needed, .event can be called.
        mopinion.event("action") {
        }
    }
}
```

## Jetpack Compose implementation ðŸš€

We do support `FragmentActivity` and `AppCompatActivity` which are completely compatible with Jetpack Compose and are non limiting or causing any deprecation to your project.

In order to use the SDK, your `MainActivity` needs to extend either from `FragmentActivity` or `AppCompatActivity`.

We do suggest the following `init` implementation as example:
```kotlin
class MainActivity: FragmentActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        Mopinion.initialise(this.application, "DEPLOYMENT_KEY")

        setContent {
            MyApplicationTheme(dynamicColor = false) {
                Surface(
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background,
                ) {
                    Navigation()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And in order to construct the `Mopinion` object in your `Composable`, we will need either a `FragmentActivity` or an `AppCompatActivity` too.

We do suggest the following `Mopinion` construction implementation:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
    val fragmentActivity = LocalContext.current as? FragmentActivity ?: handleException() //here you can handle the exception if the local context is not a FragmentActivity.
    val mopinion = remember { Mopinion(fragmentActivity) }
    Text(
        text = "Stop guessing, start knowing!",
        modifier = Modifier
            .clickable {
                mopinion.event("YourEventName")
            }
    )
}
```

## Java:

- In your MainActivity.java, Mopinion object will be initialised, it will require two values, one
  `Application` and one `String` deployment key, as the following:

```java
Mopinion.Companion.initialise(this.application, "DEPLOYMENT_KEY");
```

- Once Mopinion is initialised, it is possible to instantiate Mopinion object wherever we need it,
  keep in mind that it's processes will be lifecycle aware, to instantiate a Mopinion object it will
  require one value, an `AppCompatActivity` or `FragmentActivity`:
- Activity:

```java
public class SomeActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private Mopinion mopinion;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.some_activity);

        mopinion = new Mopinion(this);
        mopinion.event("action", formState -> Unit.INSTANCE);
    }
}
```

- Fragment:

```java
public class SomeFragment extends Fragment {

    private Mopinion mopinion;

    @Override
    protected void onViewCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

        mopinion = new Mopinion(requireActivity());
        mopinion.event("action", formState -> Unit.INSTANCE);
    }
}
```

* The `Activity` or `FragmentActivity` will be used to implement the lifecycle safe coroutine launch
  method `repeatOnLifecycle()`.
* The `initialise` should contain your deployment key. This key can be found in your
  Mopinion account at the `Feedback forms` section under `Deployments`.
* The `event` is a specific event that can be connected to a feedback form action in the Mopinion
  system. The default `action` event triggers the form, but an unlimited number of custom events can
  also be added.
* `event` is an optional lambda function, which receives a FormState Sealed Class containing the different
  FormStates, it also contains within its data classes:
    - FormSent contains `FeedbackPostModel` object with the data that has been sent.
    - FormError contains `hasErrors: Boolean` and the `errorMessage: String`.

## <a name="ignoring_proactive_rules">Ignore form rules</a>
The function `event`, receives a mandatory `String` parameter named `eventName`. Also, receives an optional parameter named `ignoreProactiveRules` which by default is set to `false`.
You can set `ignoreProactiveRules` to `true` to ignore all form rules and show the form.

```kotlin
  ///example:
mopinion.event(eventName = "myEvent", ignoreProactiveRules = true) { formState ->

}
```


## <a name="extra_data">Extra data</a>

It's also possible to send extra data from the app to your form. To do this, supply a key and a
value to the `data()` method. Add the data before calling the `event()` method if you want to
include the data in the form that comes up for that event.

```kotlin
mopinion.data(key as String, value as String)
```

```kotlin
import com.mopinion.mopinion_android_sdk.*

val mopinion = Mopinion(this / requireActivity(), "$FORM_KEY")
mopinion.data("first name", "Andy")
mopinion.data("last name", "Rubin")
...
mopinion.event(eventName as String)
```

## <a name="clear_extra_data">Clear Extra Data</a>

It's possible to remove all or a single key-value pair from the extra data previously supplied with
the `data(key,value)` method. To remove a single key-value pair use this method:

```kotlin
mopinion.removeData(key as String)
```

### Example:

```kotlin
mopinion.removeData("first name")
```

To remove all supplied extra data use this method without arguments:

```kotlin
mopinion.removeData()
```

## <a name="implementing_callbacks">Implementing FormState Callbacks</a>

The `event()` function is a lambda function which once has been executed, receives a Sealed Class
FormState. This behaviour is meant to indicate in which state the Form is. This class contains the
following States:
State|Methods|Description
---|---|---
Loading|No methods|Is emitted when the form is loading.
FormOpened|No methods|Is emitted once the form is opened.
FormSent|.feedbackPostModel/.getFeedbackPostModel()|Is emitted once the user submits the form. This Object contains FeedbackPostModel, which is the form with the data the user has submitted.
FormCanceled|No methods|Is emitted when the form is canceled (tapping outside of the BottomSheetDialogFragment or the back arrow).
FormClosed|No methods|Is emitted when the form is submitted and closes automatically, or when the form logic is set to auto-close when the form is submitted.
Error|.message/.getMessage: String, .hasErrors/.getHasErrors(): Boolean|Is emitted when an error occurs when the form is being submitted.
HasNotBeenShown|.reason/getReason(): Reason|Is emitted when due to circumstances that can not be determined as errors occur. This state has as constructor a Reason which gives a clear reason of why the form is not showing up.
Redirected|.redirectInfo: RedirectInfo?|Emitted when a link has been clicked in the SDK, with the `LinkComponent` and the user has been redirected to a URL in the browser. The RedirectInfo contains data of that redirection such as `event: String`, `formKey: String`, `formName: String`, `triggerMethod: String`, `url: String`, `redirectInfoError: String?`


As mentioned in the `HasNotBeenShown State`, this state contains a `Reason` explaining why the form did not showed up. The possible reasons by the moment are the following:
Reason|Methods|Description
---|---|---
ErrorWhileFetchingForm|.exception/.getException(): Exception|This reason is provided when fetching the form an error occurs, it contains an Exception.
DoesNotMatchProactiveRules|No methods|This reason is provided when the form rules does not match the required criteria to be shown.
EventDoesNotExist|No methods|The event provided does not exist on the deployment.
FormDoesNotExist|No methods|The form key required does not exist on backend, meaning the form key to which the GET call has been made returns an empty form. This can occur because the form has been deleted and the deployment has not been updated.




### Kotlin Example:

```kotlin
mopinion.event(event) { formState ->
    when (formState) {
        is FormState.Error -> {
            if (formState.hasErrors) {
                //do something...
                val errorMessage = formState.message
            }
        }
        FormState.FormCanceled -> {
            //do something...
        }
        FormState.FormClosed -> {
            //do something...
        }
        FormState.FormOpened -> {
            //do something...
        }
        is FormState.FormSent -> {
            //do something...
            val postedObject = formState.feedbackPostModel
            //postedObject is the object that contains the form data that has been submitted. 
        }
        FormState.Loading -> {
            //do something...
        }
        is FormState.HasNotBeenShown -> {
            //do something...
            //check why the form did not show up:
            val reasonOfWhyDidNotShowUp = formState.reason
        }
    }
}
```
If some of the States will not be used, just set the `else` and empty curly braces:
```kotlin
mopinion.event(event) { formState ->
    when (formState) {
        is FormState.Error -> {
            if (formState.hasErrors) {
                //do something...
                val errorMessage = formState.message
            }
        }
        is FormState.FormSent -> {
            //do something...
            val postedObject = formState.feedbackPostModel
            //postedObject is the object that contains the form data that has been submitted. 
        }
        else -> {
            //do nothing.
        }
    }
}
```

### Java Example:
```java
class SomeClass extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.some_activity);

        mopinion.event("action", formState -> {
            if (formState instanceof FormState.Loading) {
                //do something...
            }
            if (formState instanceof FormState.FormOpened) {
                //do something...
            }
            if (formState instanceof FormState.FormSent) {
                //do something...
                // So we can extract the posted object.
                FeedbackPostModel postedObject = ((FormState.FormSent) formState).getFeedbackPostModel();
            }
            if (formState instanceof FormState.FormCanceled) {
                //do something...
            }
            if (formState instanceof FormState.FormClosed) {
                //do something...
            }
            if (formState instanceof FormState.Error) {
                //do something...
                // It is possible to check if it has errors and extract the error message.
                if (((FormState.Error) formState).getHasErrors()) {
                    String errorMessage = ((FormState.Error) formState).getMessage();
                }
            }
            if (formState instanceof FormState.HasNotBeenShown) {
                //do something...
                //check why the form did not show up:
                Reason reasonOfWhyDidNotShowUp = ((FormState.HasNotBeenShown) formState).getReason();

            }
            return Unit.INSTANCE;
        });
    }
}
```
If some of the States will not be used, just do not implement the if sentence. Always keep the return Unit.INSTANCE in Java.
